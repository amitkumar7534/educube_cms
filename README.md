 ## flutter clean
 Sometimes, Flutter projects encounter build issues due to cached or corrupted build artifacts.
 Running flutter clean can help resolve these issues by deleting the existing build artifacts and
 forcing Flutter to rebuild them from scratch.


 ## flutter pub get
flutter pub get is a command used to retrieve dependencies specified in your Flutter project's
pubspec.yaml file. When you add or update dependencies in your project, you need to run this command
to fetch the latest versions of those dependencies from the pub.dev repository.
